# Project: Portfolio and Options Analysis.

The idea behind the project is to analyze daily opportunities in the stock market using options.

# What is an option?

Options are a financial derivative sold by an option writer to an option buyer. They are typically purchased through online or retail brokers. The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (**call option**) or sell (**put option**) the underlying asset at an agreed-upon price during a certain period of time or on a specific date. The agreed upon price is called the strike price.
